# Diablo 2 Resurrected Loader

This is a simple Qt app which manages starting multiple Diablo 2 Resurrected instances.

Be warned, it's still got a couple of rough edges.

Its heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/shupershuff/Diablo2Loader">shupershuff/Diablo2Loader</a>. Check this repo out if you want to learn more about multiboxing D2R :-)

The basic stuff works for launching multiple instances but I have a couple of features in mind that I want to implement:

- Linux/Wine Support (main reason to write this in Python; not sure how feasible this is due to the token generation with pywin32/Windows DBAPI
- TZ/DClone Tracker
- aaand maybe something like the settings switcher from Diablo2Loader (lets see how much spare time I have for gaming and coding after winter is over)
